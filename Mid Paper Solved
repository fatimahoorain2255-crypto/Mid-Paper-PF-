Question # 1: Match the C++ statements with the type of error:
1. cout "Hello"; - Ans: a. Missing operator (<<)
2. cin << a; - Ans: b. Wrong direction of extraction
3. int 2num = 5; - Ans: c. Invalid identifier name
4. cout << "Hello\World; - Ans: d. Missing quotation mark
5. if(x>0); cout<<"Yes"; - Ans: e. Logical error (Semicolon after it)
6. cout << a + b >> c; - Ans: f. Invalid operator usage

Q2 — Write the Output of conditional statements:
     True/False:
1. (14 > 6) - Ans: True
2. (12 >= 11) - Ans: True
3. !(a == b) - Ans: It will be True if a is not equal to b. It will be False if a is equal to b.
4. (12%3 == 0 || 12%5 == 0) → 12%3 == 0 is true, 12%5 == 0 is false - Ans: True
5. a = 10, b = 20, c = 15; (a > b && a > c) → 10 > 20 is false - Ans: False
6. (10 != 5*2) → 5*2 = 10 so 10 != 10 - Ans: False

Q3 — Which data type, will you select for the following values:
1.	“25.75” - Ans: string 
2.	23 - Ans: int
3.	‘A’ - Ans: char
4.	“Ali” - Ans: string

}
Output:
             9

4.	int main() {
            int a = 2.3;

          if (x > y)
          z += x;
          else if (y > z)
          z = z - y;
          else
        z = z + 2;
        cout << z;
}
Output:
               7

6.	int main() {
           int age;
           cout << "Enter age: ";
           cin >> age;
           cout << "Your age is " << age;
           return 0;
}
Output:
           Enter age: Your age is 21

7.	int main() {
           if (a > 5)
           cout << "A";
           cout << "B";
}
Output:
           Eroor 

8.	int main() {
            int x = 2, y = 3, z = 4;
            cout << x + y * z / x;
}
Output:
              8

9.	 int main() {
             int a = 5, b = 10;
            cout << (a > b ? a : b);
}
Output:
             10

10.	 int main() {
             int x = 2, y = 3;
             cout << ( (x + 1 * y + 1) + (y - 1) );
}
Output:
                8

11.	  int main()
{
      float Irate 10.5; 
      cout<<irate;
}
Output: 
            10.5

12.	 int main()
{
     if (a=5) 
     {cout << "Five";}
}
Output:
               Five
(Explanation: assignment a 5 yields non-zero true. Note: as shown this requires a declared; otherwise it's a compile error.)

13.	 int main()
{ 
     int a; 
     cout << a;
}

Output: 
              Garbage value (uninitialized variable undefined behaviour)

14.	 int main()
{ 
    cout << "She said "Hello"";
}
Output:
           Compile-time error (incorrect nested quotes-must escape inner quotes or use 17

15.	 int main()
{ 
     int = 5; 
}
Output: 
           Compile-time error (missing variable name)

16.	 int main()
{ 
     int num = "5"; 
}
Output: 
          Compile-time error (cannot assign string literal to int)

17.	 int main()
{
    cout << "Area"; 
    cout << 3.14*r*r;
}
Output: 
            Compile-time error (identifier r is undefined/undeclared)

18.	  int main()
{
      if (x > 0) { cout << "Positive";}
}
Output: 
Depends on x. If x is declared and >0 Positive. As written (no declaration) compile error/undeclared variable.

19.	 int main()
{ 
     cin << number; 
     if (number 10) 
     cout << "Equal"; 
}
Output: 
Two issues: cin << number; is wrong operator (should be cin >> number;). If corrected and user inputs 10 prints Equal; otherwise prints nothing.

20.	 int main()
{
    if (x <5&& x>2) 
    cout << "Range";
}
Output: 
Prints Range when x is greater than 2 and less than 5 (i.e. 3 or 4 for integer x). Otherwise nothing. (If x not declared compile error.)

21.	 int main()
{ 
     int result = 10/2*;
}
Output: 
Compile-time error (incomplete expression/syntax error)

22.	 int main()
{ 
    cout <<1+4>>7; 
}
Output: 
               0
(Explanation: 1+4>> 7 is evaluated as (1+4) >>7+5 >>7+0.)

23.	 int main()
{
     cout << "Path: C:\newfolder"; 
}
Output:
          Path: C:
          ewfolder
(Explanation: \n is an escape for newline- so C:\newfolder becomes C: then newline then ewfolder.)

Questioj # 5: Short question answers (1-14).

1.	 Difference between cin and cout in C++
cin reads input from standard input (keyboard) into variables (uses extraction >>), cout writes output to standard output (screen) using insertion <<.

2.	 What happens if user inputs wrong data type using cin?
cin fails and sets the stream into a fail state (cin.fail() becomes true). The variable is not assigned properly; subsequent I/O is ignored until the error state is cleared (e.g., cin.clear() and flushing the bad input). This can lead to unexpected behavior.

3.	 Differentiate between float and double
Both store floating-point numbers. float is typically 32-bit (#7 decimal digits precision). double is typically 64-bit (#15 decimal digits precision) - more precise and preferred for most calculations.

4.	 What happens if you use an uninitialized variable in an expression?
Behavior is undefined. For built-in types, it typically yields an indeterminate/garbage value and may produce unpredictable results or runtime bugs.

5.	 What is an escape sequence in C++ and why is it needed?
An escape sequence starts with a backslash (\) followed by a specific character. For example, \n (newline), \t (tab), or \" (double quote). They are needed to represent characters that cannot be typed directly into a string.

6.	 Why not just press Enter inside a string to create a new line instead of using \n?
String literals cannot contain raw unescaped newline characters (it would break the literal across lines and cause a compile error). Use \n or string concatenation or raw string literals (R"(multi-line)") to create line breaks.

7.	 Purpose of the modulus (%) operator
The % operator returns the remainder of integer division. For example, 7 % 3 results in 1. It is commonly used for parity checks (checking if a number is even or odd) or cyclic tasks.

8.	 Can else be used without preceding if? Explain.
No. else must follow an if (or else if) and is attached to the nearest unmatched if. Using else alone is a syntax error.

9.	 Can else be used without preceding if? Explain.
No. else must follow an if (or else if) and is attached to the nearest unmatched if. Using else alone is a syntax error.

10.	 What happens if you end an if condition with a semicolon?
if (cond); /..../) means the if controls an empty statement (the semicolon). The block that follows executes unconditionally. This is usually a logical bug.

11.	 Difference between and = operators
= is the assignment operator (stores right-hand value into left-hand variable). == is the equality comparison operator (tests whether two values are equal, returns true/false).

12.	Can you combine multiple relational conditions in one expression? Give example.
Yes-using logical operators &&, ||, !. Example: if (x > 0 &&x10) (...) (true when x is between 1 and 9).

13.	 What happens when operators have the same precedence?
If operators have the same precedence, evaluation order is determined by associativity (left-to-right or right-to-left). For example, a-b-cis (ab) c (left-associative).

14.	 General syntax of the ternary operator and its components
Syntax: condition? expression_if true: expression_if_false
It evaluates condition; if true it yields expression_if_true, otherwise    expression_if_false.
Often used as a short if-else for value selection.

15.	 Naming rules for identifiers in C++
Must start with a letter (A-Z, a-z) or underscore (cannot start with a digit).
After first character may contain letters, digits, or underscores.
No spaces or punctuation.
Cannot use C++ reserved keywords (like int, for, class, etc.).
Identifiers are case-sensitive (Value value).

Question # 6: C++ program.
Here is a simple, correct C++ program that implements the requested behavior:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int year;
    cout << "Enter year: ";

    if (!(cin >> year)) {
        cout << "Invalid input\n";
        return 0;
    }

    if (year >= 2000 && year <= 2015) {
        int sum = 2000 + 2015;
        cout << "Year is between 2000 and 2015 (inclusive).\n";
        cout << "Sum of 2000 and 2015 = " << sum << '\n';
    }
    else if (year >= 2016 && year <= 2025) {
        int sum = 2016 + 2025;
        cout << "Year is between 2016 and 2025 (inclusive).\n";
        cout << "Sum of 2016 and 2025 = " << sum << "\n";
    }
    else {
        cout << "Year is not in the range.\n";
        return 0;
    }

    return 0;
}
